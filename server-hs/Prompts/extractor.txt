    -Goal-
    Given text and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text.

    -Steps-
    1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
    - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
    - entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, product, service, industry]
    Format each entity as a JSON like: {"entity": <entity_name>, "entity_type": <entity_type>}

    2. Return output in a single list with all the entities identified in steps 1.

    -Examples-

    text: Another area of strength is our co-brand issuance. Visa is the primary network partner for eight of the top
    10 co-brand partnerships in the US today and we are pleased that Visa has finalized a multi-year extension of
    our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a loyal customer
    base and high cross-border usage.
    We have also had significant co-brand momentum in CEMEA. First, we launched a new co-brand card in partnership
    with Qatar Airways, British Airways and the National Bank of Kuwait. Second, we expanded our strong global
    Marriott relationship to launch Qatar's first hospitality co-branded card with Qatar Islamic Bank. Across the
    United Arab Emirates, we now have exclusive agreements with all the leading airlines marked by a recent
    agreement with Emirates Skywards.
    And we also signed an inaugural Airline co-brand agreement in Morocco with Royal Air Maroc. Now newer digital
    issuers are equally
