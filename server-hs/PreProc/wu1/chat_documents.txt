It is the same topic but much harder material.
Do not get under condemnation and assume you are doing something wrong if you go back to a topic you have not dealt with for a while. You may be in a higher grade in some areas, but lower in others. If God deals with an issue again, it does not mean you are failing. Always ask your Teacher how you are doing instead of judging yourself.
Maintaining this notebook will change your life dramatically. Commit yourself to learning by the Holy Spirit alone. One wonderful thing about the Spirit is that He can work on an area for a while, and then have recess. He is the Teacher. If He is not teaching or correcting at the moment, relax and rest in His presence. He covers what He is not dealing with. You are in His school.
It is imperative that you stay in the Spirit and remain in God’s school rather than struggle in spiritualized flesh. As I said before, when the Lord confirms you have successfully dealt with an issue, move the page to the back of your notebook. This will be your “maintenance file” and it will
 include areas where you have attained victory but still need to monitor. Items in this part of your notebook may be worked on by the Lord again when He wants to deepen and expand the topics so you can grow more.
Remember: If your Teacher addresses an issue again, this does not necessarily mean you have failed.

There are other roots attached to the taproot, but the entire root system will be destroyed when you fully submit to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. Creating and going through your notebook in the Spirit will do this work.
Be encouraged! See conviction as the blessing it is. Letting the Spirit examine every area of your life will set you free. You will begin to enjoy a relationship with God you have never had before. Think of this as the Spirit of God breaking every chain that holds you captive to your flesh and the devil. What an exciting concept!
Remember: Even though this may sound overwhelming, you only have to deal with what the Holy
 Spirit identifies. Everything else is covered by grace. Do not get overloaded with all of the information you receive. It is a great benefit to you to know every detail of how you have been wrong so you can repent and be set free. Every revelation is a blessing! Every session you have with the Holy Spirit will give you the opportunity to correct an area and become more like Christ. This is the most effective use of your time as you seek to know the Lord better.
Maintaining Your Notebook
When you overcome in an area and God says you are faithful, you can move the page to the back of your notebook. This does not mean He will not work on the subject again at a deeper level. Think of the difference between mathematics in first grade versus calculus in college.

One final word before we move on: I encourage you to use a pen and paper to create your notebook instead of a computer. This is what I did over forty years ago and I have never wavered in my commitment to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
The Lord told me that technology can lead to distractions. Trust me on this! I know the way I did it works because of the fruit that is evident in my life. It is too easy to let your mind get distracted when you use a computer and subconsciously you may hold on to control. It is time to let go of the control once and for all!
Note: Using technology to look up scriptures and Strong’s definitions may help you with your research. However, be sure to ask the Lord about this. He may require you to use reference books because this is necessary to help you slow down and hear His voice more clearly. The key is to take your time and not rush the process.

Ask the Lord to show you the reasons why your spiritual life is not as it should be. Write in your notebook any excuses you have made for why you are behind spiritually. Write down any revelation He shows you.

As you feel a flow of peace, go page by page and listen to the Spirit as your Teacher. You only have to work on the area the Holy Spirit chooses. All other areas are covered by grace until it is time to deal with them.
You only have to work on the area the Holy Spirit chooses.
There will always be something in your notebook He wants to reveal to you. If He shows you something on a topic, write it on a page with the date He shows it to you. Whether it requires you to stop doing something or begin doing something, start practicing what your Teacher says. Once again, remember to keep it simple! As long as you present yourself to the Teacher with an open heart that embraces all of God’s standards, your Teacher will only require you to do whatever He specifies.
All of the items on the other pages in your notebook are covered by grace and do not separate you from fellowship with the Lord. When grace covers an issue, it is not counted against you at the present time, but it is still important. If you are faithful and do not procrastinate, God will deal with each sin in His timing. You can always trust Him to be faithful in the work He does in you.
This does not make sense to the natural mind, but it is the truth.

There is great freedom in knowing where you are! If you are behind, God’s mercy will cleanse you as you repent, and His grace will take you where you need to go.
How to Use Your Notebook
As you process the instructions in this book, it is important to keep a record of what the Holy Spirit shows you. This helps you identify what you need to repent of and work on, as well as keeps you focused on what the Lord is doing in your life. Remember that it is important to pray a spiritual covering over your time before the Lord. The devil does not
 want you to have victory over him, and he will try to interfere with this process in any way he can.
When the Holy Spirit reveals an issue He wants to address (sin, lies you believe, new revelation, and so on), the first thing you need to do is make a note of what He says and the date He says it. Then ask the Spirit to show you any revelation you need in that particular area. Go through this process slowly! One revelation may have multiple subcategories that do not need their own page. You may find many revelations about one particular subject.
If you are unable to get additional revelation, ask the Holy Spirit to show you why you cannot hear any details.

The taproot is always taking over lordship, but sometimes it takes time to work your way down the path from the fruit to the root. (The picture of the trees in My Sheep Hear My Voice illustrates the path from fruit to root level. It is important to note that the “trunk” of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that is, your lordship, is always selfishness.) The Lord has all of the answers you need as He exposes your sin, and He will set you free as you confess and repent. Let Him do the work to change your heart!
As you read the Bible, hear a sermon or receive direct revelation, add a new page to your notebook every time you are convicted. Then work through each area as the Lord directs. Some will be faster and easier than others.
When a problem area has been completely repented of and the Lord says it is no longer a problem, I suggest you move the page to the back of your notebook in a separate section so you can check it from time to time. It is always a good idea to recheck areas where you have gained victory to be sure you
 are maintaining your repentance. In other words, you continue to practice what God has shown you and you no longer have the habit of the sin. Having this section will encourage you as you see progress being made.
If satan has had access to an area for years, he will try to re-establish it.

 Assignment
If you have had trouble obeying the Lord with a right motive (love), it is likely you do not understand how much He loves you. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you specific ways God has manifested His love to you in recent days and weeks as well as in the distant past. Ask Him to show you blessings He has given you that you have never been aware of.
Recognize that His gifts are given because He loves you so much. As God opens your eyes, make note of the blessings He has given you in a section of your notebook. If you are not enjoying those blessings as you should, list each hindrance the Holy Spirit reveals to you.

Ask the Lord to show you where your spiritual life has been hindered because you did not understand that God sees in fullness. Look at areas where He has convicted you when you did not think you were wrong. Ask Him to show you areas where you have felt condemnation because you were not obeying a commandment “perfectly.” Write down what He shows you in your notebook.
Remember the lesson about the classroom. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you what is required of you each day and simply obey Him. Repent of any areas of unfaithfulness He reveals, and start obeying where you are.
It is crucial to allow God to show you where you are spiritually. It does not matter if you have been in ministry for many years. Be honest and let the Lord reveal your true spiritual age. If you find you are in a much lower “grade” than you thought, do not get under condemnation. The Lord has always known your true spiritual level, and He is not angry with you even if you are not where you should be. In fact, He is eagerly waiting for you to see the truth so He can minister forgiveness to you. The Holy Spirit is longing to begin teaching you where you are!

 You are only responsible to do what God tells you to do. Do not waste time looking at others’ callings or responsibilities. You will be judged on your faithfulness to do what God tells you to do, not what He tells someone else to do. Avoiding comparisons with others will free you from judgment (which is sin). It will also free you from self- exaltation or condemnation (which is also sin). Do not let satan divert you from God’s directions by tempting you to focus on others.
 Assignment
Ask the Lord for directions in things He knows you are capable of obeying now. Then obey Him because you love Him. This will start building your confidence. As you obey, the sowing and reaping principle will begin to manifest in you. Galatians 6:7b says, “...for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.” As your love and obedience grow, love will be multiplied back to you. God’s love and grace will then enable you to obey more difficult commandments.
Ask the Lord to show you how you respond to conviction. Do you embrace it in some situations but resist or get offended in others? You may find that you are unwilling to repent in certain areas. Ask Him to show you details about why you respond the way you do. List the revelations you receive from the Spirit in your notebook.

If you judge God’s ways as irrelevant in today’s world, you are in the flesh. You may be holding on to your lordship because you are afraid of what will happen if Jesus is in control. Your trust may be hindered because God made a decision in your life that you did not think was fair. There can be many reasons why you are unwilling for Jesus to be the Lord of your life.
You must face how you truly feel and what you actually do. If your fruit indicates you are lord, then you are lord. Making excuses does not justify your lordship. Your motives and behavior must be examined, without an opinion, by the Word and the Holy Spirit.
A Common Excuse
The most common excuse I hear from intelligent or well- educated Christians for not submitting to the Lord is, “God gave me a brain and He expects me to use it.” This comes from the false assumption that when Jesus is Lord, you will not use your mind. The truth is, you will use your mind more than ever. The difference is you will use your mind to follow directions instead of making your own decisions.
God will use your mind to be trained and prepared in His kingdom. In fact, the use of your mind will actually be greatly expanded because you will have access to information in the kingdom of God. This is part of your heritage but you cannot enjoy your heritage if you live in the wrong kingdom.
